Interview: Foundry‚Äôs Mike Colyer On Bitcoin Mining In North America
Something I have been trying to better understand lately is how will Bitcoin scale. I found this interview and it was super helpful. I'm sure a lot of people here will find this helpful too.
Ok, so everyone know that there will be 21M BTC, but what happens when BTC is burned and supply decreases? How much can the price go up ? Now just mwBTC has these protocols, but in the distant future if more similar protocols are developed, do you think it can end the supply of BTC?
What‚Äôs better?
I feel like everyone has a "Lightbulb" moment when Bitcoin finally starts making sense. Everyone here was probably skeptical of Bitcoin at some point in time. It was cool hearing Michael Saylor's "Lightbulb" moment since he is such a big advocate for Bitcoin now.

Serious question: When stacks of orders on the exact same price roll through for minutes at a time, is that like... a robot putting those orders in? I don't see how it's possible for that many people to decide on that price?
